# run_for_fun
In this notebook I do some basic analysis on the results of the Oatley Park Run For Fun 2018.

Oatley Park Run For Fun is a 5K run in Oatley Park, Sydney. More info here: https://www.oatleyparkfunrun.com/
The results are publicly available here: https://www.onlinetiming.com.au/2018-oatley-park-fun-run/#3_4AF57B

I will explore how I did compared to my age and gender group.
I'll also draw some plots to see if the age and gender are relevant or not in the completion time.
