# run_for_fun
In this notebook I do some basic analysis on the results of the Oatley Park Run For Fun 2018.

Oatley Park Run For Fun is a 5K run in Oatley Park, Sydney.

I will explore how I did compared to my age and gender group.
I'll also draw some plots to see if the age and gender are relevant or not in the completion time.
